Laptop Price Prediction
Objective: To develop a predictive model for estimating the price of laptops based on their specifications. By leveraging various supervised machine learning algorithms, we aim to identify the most accurate model for price prediction, providing valuable insights for both consumers and manufacturers in the laptop market.

About the Dataset: The dataset laptop_data.csv contains the following columns:

Unnamed: 0: An index column.
Company: The brand or manufacturer of the laptop (e.g., Dell, Apple, HP).
TypeName: The type or category of the laptop (e.g., Ultrabook, Gaming, Notebook).
Inches: The screen size of the laptop in inches.
ScreenResolution: The resolution of the laptop screen (e.g., 1920x1080, 1366x768).
Cpu: The central processing unit (CPU) model and speed of the laptop.
Ram: The amount of random access memory (RAM) in the laptop, typically measured in GB.
Memory: The storage capacity and type of the laptop (e.g., 256GB SSD, 1TB HDD).
Gpu: The graphics processing unit (GPU) model in the laptop.
OpSys: The operating system installed on the laptop (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux).
Weight: The weight of the laptop in kilograms.
Price: The price of the laptop, which is the target variable for prediction.
Significance:

Consumer Decision-Making: By predicting laptop prices based on specifications, consumers can make more informed purchasing decisions and find the best value for their money.
Market Analysis: Manufacturers and retailers can use the model to analyze market trends, optimize pricing strategies, and understand the impact of various features on the overall price.
Product Development: Insights gained from the model can guide manufacturers in designing laptops that meet consumer demands while maintaining competitive pricing.
By implementing and comparing various supervised machine learning algorithms, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, KNeighborsRegressor, DecisionTreeRegressor, SupportVectorRegressor, RandomForestRegressor, and Adaboost Regressor, we aim to identify the most effective model for accurate laptop price prediction.
